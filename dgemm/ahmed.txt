analyzing CPU 0:
  driver: intel_pstate
  CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 0
  CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 0
  maximum transition latency:  Cannot determine or is not supported.
  hardware limits: 800 MHz - 3.80 GHz
  available cpufreq governors: performance powersave
  current policy: frequency should be within 800 MHz and 3.80 GHz.
                  The governor "powersave" may decide which speed to use
                  within this range.
  current CPU frequency: Unable to call hardware
  current CPU frequency: 1.60 GHz (asserted by call to kernel)
  boost state support:
    Supported: yes
    Active: yes
